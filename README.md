# Stock-Price-Prediction-and-Analysis-
📈 Stock Price Prediction & Analysis Web App
🔥 Powered by LSTM Deep Learning Model + Flask

This project is an end-to-end Stock Price Prediction and Analysis Web Application that uses a trained LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) deep learning model to forecast stock trends based on historical market data.
It also visualizes essential technical indicators such as EMA 20, 50, 100, 200 and generates Actual vs Predicted graphs.

Built using: Python, Flask, Keras, yFinance, Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas

🚀 Features

✔ Fetches real-time stock data using yFinance
✔ LSTM-based future stock price prediction
✔ EMA trend visualization (20, 50, 100, 200)
✔ Actual vs Predicted graph comparison
✔ Auto-generates downloadable CSV file
✔ Clean, simple, user-friendly web interface
✔ Flask-based backend + HTML/CSS/JS frontend
✔ Error handling for invalid stock symbols

▶️ How to Run the Project Locally
Step 1: Clone this repository
git clone <your_repo_url>

Step 2: Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Add the trained model
Place the file stock_dl_model.h5 in the project folder.

Step 4: Run the Flask server
python app.py

Step 5: Open in your browser

📊 Output Preview
1️⃣ EMA Trend Charts (20, 50)
📌 Automatically generated after prediction
2️⃣ EMA Trend Charts (100, 200)
3️⃣ Actual vs Predicted Stock Price


🧩 How the Model Works

The LSTM model was trained on:
10 years of stock price data
Closing price as the primary feature
100-day historical window
MinMax scaled dataset
70% training, 30% testing

The trained model predicts future values which are then inverse-scaled to actual prices.

🌟 Future Enhancements

🚀 Add RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands
🚀 Add multi-stock comparison dashboard
🚀 Deploy the app on Render / Railway / AWS
🚀 Add Buy/Sell/Hold suggestion system
🚀 Build a React or Streamlit frontend
